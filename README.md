# datapath-generator
really cool program to generate datapaths

This program takes high level pseudo code and converts it using C++ to verilog. This is done by first reading in the input .txt file and parsing relevant information into data structures. These data structures are then evaluated for completeness and thoroughly error checked. The .v template is formed and the variables and operations are filled in appropriately, constructing a verilog implementation of the high level pseudo code.

This is not an *efficient* way to do this, but it is *a* way.
